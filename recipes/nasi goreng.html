    <h4><p>Nasi Goreng is essentially Indonesia's take on fried rice. In addition to kecap manis, the country's ubiquitous sweet soy sauce,
    terasi (Indonesian shrimp paste) is what sets nasi goreng apart from other fried-rice variations you'll see in other countries.
    Terasi is an umami bomb that pervades both your kitchen and your senses. If you can't find it easily, feel free to substitute
    another Southeast Asian shrimp paste, or omit it—you’ll be making what my mom calls nasi goreng cina, or Chinese fried rice,
    which is the version she made for us when I was growing up.</p></h4>

    <h4> <p>Ingredients</p> </h4>
    <ol>
            <p></p>
        For the Spice Paste:
            <p></p>
        <li>2 small shallots (2 ounces; 55g), roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 medium cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 large fresh green chile, such as Fresno or Holland, stemmed and seeded, or 1 teaspoon sambal oelek,
            such as Huy Fong (see note)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon terasi (Indonesian shrimp paste), optional (see note)</li>
            <p></p>
        For the Nasi Goreng:
            <p></p>
        <li>4 cups cold cooked jasmine rice (21 ounces; 600g) or other medium- to long-grain rice (see note)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) neutral oil, such as canola or sunflower oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) kecap manis (see note), plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons (10ml) soy sauce</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        
    </ol>


    <h4><p>Method</p></h4>

    <ul>
        <b><li> STEP 1 </li></b> </p>

        Put the rice in a medium heavy-based saucepan and add 520ml water. Quickly bring to the boil, stir once and cover
        with a tight-fitting lid. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 mins. Uncover, fluff up with a fork and spread over
        a tray. Set aside to cool.
        
        <p><b><li> STEP 2 </li></b></p>
        Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Pour in the beaten egg and, as it begins
        to cook, use a spatula to bring large flakes of cooked egg into the middle of the omelette. Continue to cook like
        this for a couple of mins, then leave the rest of the egg to set completely. Flip the omelette over and transfer to
        a plate to cool before cutting it into long, thin shreds.
        
        <p><b><li> STEP 3 </li></b></p>
        Drop the beans into a pan of boiling salted water and cook for 3 mins. Drain, refresh under cold water and set aside.
        
        <p><b><li> STEP 4 </li></b></p>
        Heat the remaining oil in a wok or large, deep frying pan until almost smoking. Add the chicken and prawns, and
        stir-fry for 1 min. Tip in the shallots, garlic, chillies and carrots, and stir-fry for a further 2 mins until the
        carrot is just tender. Add the spice paste and stir-fry for 1 min more. Add the tomato purée, kecap manis, cooked rice
        and green beans, and stir-fry over a high heat for 2 mins. Add the soy sauce, spring onions and shredded omelette, and
        toss together.
        
        <p><b><li> STEP 1 </li></b></p>
        Spoon the nasi goreng onto warmed plates. Overlap the cucumber and tomato on the side of each plate, sprinkle over the
        crispy fried onions and serve with prawn crackers.
    </ul>
